WiFiShield_OSC_i2c
==================

Arduino sketch for XBee Carrier and WiFi Bee, transmitting Accelerometer and Gyro data via Open Sound Control (OSC)

I had a lot of trouble finding code for forming OSC packets for WiShield, so I hope this helps somebody out there!

The OSC code was based on ArdOSCForWiFlyHQ by Zapalot (https://github.com/Zapalot/ArdOscForWiFlyHQ) and is adapted 

for use on a WiShield project.

It could be tidier and any additions and changes are obviously welcome.
